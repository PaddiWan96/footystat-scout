# footystat-scout
This colab takes statistics from a season across the top seven women's football leagues and allows the user to compare one player to every other using Nearest Neighbours. The stats are taken from FBRef. 


# Note! Goalkeepers are not included in this data as their statistics are too unique for comparison with all the other positions.
